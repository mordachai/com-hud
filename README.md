# City of Mist: Character HUD

**City of Mist: Character HUD** is a simple always-open, never-in-the-way HUD that allows players to select tags and statuses to be used on move rolls. No questions, no menus. Just select and roll using the moves in the hotbar. Fast and streamlined like any _action-packed game_ should be!

1. Select your character token.
2. Choose tags (Power/Weakness) from the HUD.
3. Choose statuses. Click over them to toggle if they are positive, negative, or neutral:
    - Blue (+): will add to the tags calculated in the roll
    - Yellow (-): will subtract from the tags calculated in the roll
    - Grey (0): will do nothing to the roll. If a tag has no use in the next roll let it be like this
4. Click the corresponding move macro in the macro hotbar.

_**Note:** Check how on the roll card in the chat window the total modifier (âš¡) displays the correct value with the status and tags summed up after the roll._

The results and move effects will be automatically displayed in the chat.

## Known Issues

- If you close the HUD you will need deselect than select your token again to bring the HUD back
- The inputs are not bidirectional. Use the normal character sheet to register anything, the only purpose of the HUD is to make rolls easier and fast. Be especially aware of your burned tags.
